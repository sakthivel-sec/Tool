Suricata is an open-source network threat detection engine that performs real-time intrusion detection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), and network security monitoring (NSM). It is used to monitor network traffic, detect malicious activity, and provide insights into network security.

Key Features of Suricata:

Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Detects and prevents network threats using predefined rules and signatures.
Network Security Monitoring: Provides detailed insights into network traffic patterns and anomalies.
Multi-Threaded Architecture: Supports high-speed network environments with efficient use of multiple CPU cores.
Protocol Identification: Detects and analyzes various network protocols, including HTTP, FTP, DNS, and more.
Customizable Rules: Allows users to create and modify rules to detect specific types of network traffic.

pip install pyqt5


# This is a sample Suricata rules file.

alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"HTTP traffic"; sid:1000001;)
alert udp any any -> any 53 (msg:"DNS query"; sid:1000002;)
alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET 22 (msg:"SSH traffic"; sid:1000003;)
alert ip $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"Any traffic from home net"; sid:1000004;)

Explanation:
alert: The action to be taken when the rule matches (alert, drop, etc.).
tcp, udp, ip: Protocols that the rule applies to.
any any -> any 80: Source and destination IP addresses and ports.
msg:"HTTP traffic": The message that will be logged when the rule matches.
sid:1000001;: The unique identifier for the rule.

Usage in Your Tool:
Save the above content in a file named example.rules.
You can load this file into your PyQt5 application using the "Load Rules File" button.
